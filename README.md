## Introduction

This is the project for reproducible research class week 2 project.

This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring
device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the
day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous
individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012
and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

## Data

The data for this assignment can be downloaded from the course web
site:

* Dataset: [Activity monitoring data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip) [52K]

The variables included in this dataset are:

* **steps**: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing
    values are coded as `NA`)

* **date**: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD
    format

* **interval**: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which
    measurement was taken

## Assignment
* Code for reading in the dataset and/or processing the data
* Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
* Mean and median number of steps taken each day
* Time series plot of the average number of steps taken
* The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps
* Code to describe and show a strategy for imputing missing data
* Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed
* Panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends
* All of the R code needed to reproduce the results (numbers, plots, etc.) in the report
